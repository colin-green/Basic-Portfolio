      <p>Hello! My name is Colin Green. I am 26 years old, and I live in Atlanta, Georgia. Ever since I was little, I have loved video games, computers, and technology.</p>
      <p>I recently started a Coding Bootcamp at Georgia Tech, and I am very excited to complete it! By the end of it, I'm hoping to have an extensive and detailed portfolio.</p>
      <p>Since 2006, I have been competing in tournaments for my favorite video game: a fighting game called Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube. I've been recognized as one of the top 40 players in the world for 6 years in a row. I also enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, watching anime, and speedrunning other video games.</p>
